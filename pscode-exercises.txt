// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Begin
input a,b
sum <- a+b
print "sum"
End 	

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Being
Read x
if x%2==0
print "even"
if else print "odd"
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin
Read x1, x2, x3, x4, x5

Write "THe average is"
Set avg to (x1+x2+x3+x4+x5>/5
Write avg

if (x1<x2)
Set max to n2
if else set max to x3
if (x3>max)
set max to x3
if (x4>max)
set max to x4
if (x5>max)
set max to x5
write "The max is"
Write max

if (x1>x2)
set min to x2
if else set min to x1
if (x3<min)
set min to x3
if (x4<min)
set min to x4
if (x5<min)
set min to x5
Write "THe min is"
Write min
